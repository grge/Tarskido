HP: Completely broken or incredibly annoying unless fixed
MP: Must fix before releasing MVP
LP: Want to fix, but could release without it

Graph:
- MP: Horizontal scroll bar if graph is too wide. 
- MP: Toggle to show/hide graph?
- LP: Curvy arrows on graph
- LP: Graph animations? 
- LP: Clusters can be collapsed/expanded
- LP: The graph should show the context node's full ancestor context (maybe?)
- LP: The graph should always show the predecessors and successors of the context node (currently it only shows an anchor of these)
- LP: Remove redundent edges from the graph (optionally). I.e., if A depends on B and C, and B also depends on C, don't show C -> A.

Other:
- HP: Demo bookshelf list, loading from GitHub, fallback to local, etc. Revamp front page.
- MP: Clean up low screen width css 
- MP: Audit consistency of type. Fonts, font sizes, margins, etc 
- LP: Better chapter and section views. Perhaps show a mini TOC of each subsection when viewing a chapter node.
- LP: "View dependencies" option when viewing a node. Shows the recursive predecessors of the node, and presents them in a topological order.
- LP: Prevent self-links when editing parent or reference links
- LP: Overhaul edit pages
- LP: Table of contents sidebar
- LP: hovering over the navigation links like "up", "next", "previous" should highlight the corresponding node in the graph.
- LP: pass nodes into components wherever possible, instead of passing the nodeId and looking it up in the store.
- LP: Redesign reference glyphs
- LP: Table of all nodes in the book, with search and filter options.
