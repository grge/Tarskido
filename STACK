HP: Completely broken or incredibly annoying unless fixed
MP: Must fix before releasing MVP
LP: Want to fix, but could release without it


- HP: Demo bookshelf list, loading from GitHub, fallback to local, etc. Revamp front page.
- HP: Auto-slug doesn't wok. Also, slugs often clobber each other when manually editing. E.g., "defintion-1.10" clobbers "definition-1.1"
- HP: Import book dialog doesn't work - clicking "Import book" should open file picker but appears to do nothing
- HP: Book list doesn't refresh after creating new book - requires page refresh to see new books

- MP: Better chapter and section views. Perhaps show a mini TOC of each subsection when viewing a chapter node.
- MP: Fix animation of background colour for graph nodes that change colour
- MP: Highlighted clusters' labels are not visible on the graph

- LP: Audit consistency of type. Fonts, font sizes, margins, etc 
- LP: The graph BBOX calculation does not include edges, so in rare circumstances edges get clipped off.
- LP: seperation of concerns in BookShelfStore and BookStore. Also, places like components/BookShelf.vue
- LP: Node table: Search
- LP: Node table: Topological sort
  LP: Node table: Edit and Delete buttons
  LP: Node table: Filters
- LP: Graph clusters don't have correct z-ordering. Should topo sort before rendering.
- LP: Persist graph options, and add a "reset to defaults" button
- LP: Persist edit mode toggle
- LP: Horizontal line below graph sometimes disapears when browser zoom < 100%?
- LP: New view: Graph fullscreen with side panel for content
- LP: Clusters can be collapsed/expanded on the graph
- LP: Full dependencies view. Shows the recursive predecessors of the node in topological order.
- LP: Prevent self-links when editing parent or reference links
- LP: Overhaul edit pages
- LP: Table of contents sidebar
- LP: hovering over the navigation links like "up", "next", "previous" should highlight the corresponding node in the graph.
- LP: pass nodes into components wherever possible, instead of passing the nodeId and looking it up in the store.
- LP: Redesign reference glyphs
- LP: Fix TypeScript type checking and ESLint errors throughout codebase
