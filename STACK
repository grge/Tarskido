- MP: Next/Prev links don't work
- MP: Contents page should sort elements by reference, same as I do in the Node view.
- 10m, LP: download this book link is ugly

- 2h, LP: hovering over the navigation links like "up", "next", "previous" should highlight the corresponding node in the graph.
- LP: TOC links look ugly
- LP: Fix word breaking in the markdown preview.
- MP: pass node's into components wherever possible, instead of passing the nodeId and looking it up in the store.
- LP: Graph animations?
