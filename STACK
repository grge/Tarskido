HP: Completely broken or incredibly annoying unless fixed
MP: Must fix before releasing MVP
LP: Want to fix, but could release without it

- MP: Animate option in graph menu does nothing
- MP: Audit consistency of type. Fonts, font sizes, margins, etc 
- MP: seperation of concerns in BookShelfStore and BookStore. Also, places like components/BookShelf.vue
- MP: The Prev/Next links don't use slugs. I think I need a slug link component.
- MP: Graph child nodes don't appear if they don't have external links
- MP: Fix animation of background colour for graph nodes that change colour
- MP: Clusters containing other clusters don't show correctly in the graph. 
- MP: Highlighted clusters' labels are not visible on the graph
- LP: The BBOX calculation does not include edges, so in rare circumstances edges get cut off.
- LP: Persist graph options, and add a "reset to defaults" button
- LP: Horizontal line below graph sometimes disapears when browser zoom < 100%?
- LP: New view: Graph fullscreen with side panel for content
- LP: Clusters can be collapsed/expanded on the graph
- LP: Better chapter and section views. Perhaps show a mini TOC of each subsection when viewing a chapter node.
- LP: Full dependencies view. Shows the recursive predecessors of the node in topological order.
- LP: Prevent self-links when editing parent or reference links
- LP: Overhaul edit pages
- LP: Table of contents sidebar
- LP: hovering over the navigation links like "up", "next", "previous" should highlight the corresponding node in the graph.
- LP: pass nodes into components wherever possible, instead of passing the nodeId and looking it up in the store.
- LP: Redesign reference glyphs
- LP: Table of all nodes in the book, with search and filter options.
