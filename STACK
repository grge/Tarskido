HP: Completely broken or incredibly annoying unless fixed
MP: Must fix before releasing MVP
LP: Want to fix, but could release without it


Graph:
- MP: The graph doesn't display any nodes unless there are edges involved
- MP: The graph should show the context node's full ancestor context (maybe?)
- MP: The graph should always show the predecessors and successors of the context node (currently it only shows an anchor of these)
- MP: Clusters consistently coloured
- MP: Dynamically sized nodes. Render nodes -> compute sizes -> graph layout -> render nodes again
- LP: Curvy arrows on graph
- LP: Graph animations? 
- LP: optimize subgraph generation
- LP: Clusters can be collapsed/expanded

Other:
- MP: hamburger button color inconsistent. need color scheme revisit. Maybe just delete top bar.
- MP: toggle to enable/disable editing mode
- MP: download this book link is ugly. Remove it and replace with a secret url?
- MP: Fix word breaking in the markdown preview.
- MP: TOC links look ugly
- MP: Next/Prev links don't work
- MP: Wide three-column typographical layout
- LP: hovering over the navigation links like "up", "next", "previous" should highlight the corresponding node in the graph.
- LP: pass nodes into components wherever possible, instead of passing the nodeId and looking it up in the store.
- LP: Revisit markdown library. markdown-it is faster?
- LP: Redesign reference glyphs
