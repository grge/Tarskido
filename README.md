# Tarskido

A markdown editor for math notes. 

##

Tarskido is an app for building math books using markdown and $\LaTeX$. Each book
in Tarskido is a directed graph of nodes representing definitions and propositions,
where edges in the graph indicate logical precedence. The graph is also overlayed
with a heirarchy indicating the chapter and section structure.

Tarksido has been built using Vue 3 and Vite.

This project has been created to help me keep notes while studying, and will not
be supported.

## Project Setup

npm install
